# Premier League Match Outcome Prediction

This project implements a **machine learning pipeline** for predicting English Premier League (EPL) match outcomes using a **Random Forest classifier**, and compares its performance against a **LightGBM model**.

## 📊 Project Overview

Football match outcomes are inherently unpredictable due to the complex interactions of form, tactics, and chance. This project aims to reduce that unpredictability by using historical match data to train predictive models that estimate the probabilities of different outcomes (Home Win, Draw, Away Win).

### Key Features

- 🎯 Binary or multi-class prediction of match outcomes.
- 🌲 Random Forest classifier implementation using `scikit-learn`.
- ⚡ LightGBM classifier implementation for comparison.
- 📈 Model evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, precision and recall;
- 🧼 Data preprocessing including feature engineering (form, goal difference, etc.)
